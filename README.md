3D Text Editor in C#/.NET/XNA/VS2010

Originally written partially as an experiment in 3D rendering of text, partially a text editor/integrated development environment
lite in the style of sublime text and latterly something like Visual Studio Code.  Based on the deprecated XNA framework.

Has some nice demo videos on youtube:
