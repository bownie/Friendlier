1. General. The Xyglo software and any third party software (including any content), documentation and any fonts accompanying this Licence whether on disk, in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively known as the "Xyglo Software") are licenced, not sold, to you by Xyglo Ltd ("Xyglo") for use only under the terms of this Licence, and Xyglo reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. You own the media on which the Xyglo Software is recorded but Xyglo and/or Xyglo's licensor(s) retain ownership of the Xyglo Software itself. The terms of this Licence will govern any software upgrades provided by Xyglo that replace and/or supplement the original Xyglo Software product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate licence in which case the terms of that licence will govern.

2. Permitted Licence Uses and Restrictions.

A. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, you are granted a limited non-exclusive licence to install and use one copy of the Xyglo Software.  You may not make the Xyglo Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You may make one copy of the Xyglo Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.

B. Certain components of the Xyglo Software, and third party open source programs included with the Xyglo Software, have been or may be made available by Xyglo on its Open Source web site (http://www.xyglo.com/) (collectively the "Open-Sourced Components"). You may modify or replace only these Open-Sourced Components; provided that: (i) the resultant modified Xyglo Software is used, in place of the unmodified Xyglo Software; and (ii) you otherwise comply with the terms of this Licence and any applicable licensing terms governing use of the Open-Sourced Components. Xyglo is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the resultant modified Xyglo Software.

C. You may not, and you agree not to, or to enable others to, copy (except as and only to the extent permitted in this Licence), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of the Xyglo Software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law).

3. Transfer. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicence the Xyglo Software. You may, however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your licence rights to the Xyglo Software to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Xyglo Software, including all its component parts, original media, printed materials and this Licence; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Xyglo Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Xyglo Software reads and agrees to accept the terms and conditions of this Licence. You may not rent, lease, lend, redistribute, sublicence or transfer any Xyglo Software that has been modified or replaced under Section 2C above. All components of the Xyglo Software are provided as part of a bundle and may not be separated from the bundle and distributed as standalone applications.

Updates: If an Xyglo Software update completely replaces (full install) a previously licenced version of the Xyglo Software, you may not use both versions of the Xyglo Software at the same time nor may you transfer them separately.

NFR (Not for Resale) Copies: Notwithstanding other sections of this Licence, Xyglo Software labeled or otherwise provided to you on a promotional basis may only be used for demonstration, testing and evaluation purposes and may not be resold or transferred.

Academic Copies: If the Xyglo Software retail package is labeled "Academic Single User", you must be an Eligible Educational End User to use the Xyglo Software. "Eligible Educational End Users" means students, faculty, staff and administration attending and/or working at an educational institutional facility (i.e. college campus, public or private schools).

Xyglo may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve our products or to provide services or technologies to you.

5. Termination. This Licence is effective until terminated. Your rights under this Licence will terminate automatically without notice from Xyglo if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this Licence.

Your exclusive remedy under this Section shall be, at Xyglo’s option, a refund of the purchase price of the product containing the Xyglo Software or replacement of the Xyglo Software that is returned to Xyglo or an Xyglo authorized representative with a copy of the receipt. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY AND ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES ON THE MEDIA INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, AND OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ORIGINAL RETAIL PURCHASE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH HEREIN IS THE ONLY WARRANTY MADE TO YOU AND IS PROVIDED IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER WARRANTIES (IF ANY) CREATED BY ANY DOCUMENTATION OR PACKAGING. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY BY JURISDICTION.

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE XYGLO SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY ON MEDIA SET FORTH ABOVE AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE XYGLO SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND XYGLO AND XYGLO'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "XYGLO" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 7 AND 8) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE XYGLO SOFTWARE, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY XYGLO OR AN XYGLO AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE XYGLO SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL XYGLO BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE XYGLO SOFTWARE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF XYGLO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Xyglo's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.
