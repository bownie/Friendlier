FONTS
-----
- Fuzzy fonts - some tips:

  + http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/15469/how-do-i-get-beautiful-small-text-in-xna-without-using-external-libraries
  + Need to overhaul the font rendering completely
  + Tried nuclex - looks good but artifacts [FIXED - much better]
  + Therefore add zoom level and full screenness to fontmanager and add extra font levels - match font level to zoom level [DOESN'T PLAY NICELY]
  + The above won't work - we have to stick with same size but at least we can modify some processing directives [NO REAL ADVANTAGE]
  + Ensured that all drawStrings are aligned on integers[DONE]
  + The added Matrix 0.5 modifier for X and Y to spread integer evenly when projecting [DONE]

BUGs and OTHER TODOS
--------------------
- search highlight all occurences on the scrollbar
- compare directories - smart compare 
- drag and drop directory insertion
- file browser remembers last directory positions
- coloured and textured backgrounds for editing windows
- animations and intro
- change buffer show length interactively
- auto colouring build paths (executable paths, directories etc)
- undo remembers last highlight [PENDING]
- overlapping BufferViews
- copy section into new BufferView [ALMOST DONE]
- moving to bufferviews with the alt + direction buttons [DONE - but bug with positions when mode switches due to font sizing]
- some way of seeing/modifying/deleting bufferviews (and their indexes) in project
- Saving/opening/browsing - ensure status is correct
- Logging (timestamps and makes sense)
