- Fuzzy fonts - some tips:

  + http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/15469/how-do-i-get-beautiful-small-text-in-xna-without-using-external-libraries
  + Need to overhaul the font rendering completely
  + Tried nuclex - looks good but artifacts [FIXED]
  + Therefore add zoom level and full screenness to fontmanager and add extra font levels - match font level to zoom level
  + The above won't work - we have to stick with same size but at least we can modify some processing directives
  + Ensured that all drawStrings are aligned on integers[DONE]

- improve search
- some way of seeing/modifying/deleting files in project / visualisation of project contents  [STARTED]
- Kinect integration [STARTED]
- resizing window [IN PROGRESS]
- zooming is not very good at the moment [IN PROGRESS]
- save as not working [IN PROGRESS]
- scrolling and cut and paste on parameter editing and information screen

- Licence file [STARTED]

  + Fonts licence
  + append to licence terms

- Registry key and licence key [Need to make sure that this is run at installation time as administrator - not through the program itself]

- Icons [PROVED but need a good one]

Build version:

http://autobuildversion.codeplex.com/

1.1 DONE
--------
- f-keys for zooming etc is unnatural [CHANGED to CURSOR plus ALT SHIFT] 
- highlight on scrollbar [DONE]



BUGs and OTHER TODOS
--------------------
- search highlight all occurences on the scrollbar
- compare directories - smart compare 
- drag and drop file and directory insertion
- file browser remembers last directory positions
- coloured and textured backgrounds for editing windows
- animations and intro
- change buffer show length interactively
- auto colouring build paths (executable paths, directories etc)
- undo remembers last highlight [PENDING]
- overlapping BufferViews
- copy section into new BufferView [ALMOST DONE]
- moving to bufferviews with the alt + direction buttons [DONE - but bug with positions when mode switches due to font sizing]
- some way of seeing/modifying/deleting bufferviews (and their indexes) in project
- Saving/opening/browsing - ensure status is correct
- Logging (timestamps and makes sense) 

NOTES
-----
